## Using Phoenix Wallet as web version

Run `npm run build:web`. The output of `dist` is the web version.
It can be dropped into the `html/ui` folder in the BRS jar file, or served statically elsewhere. 

## Running a full node

Running a full node strengthens the network and adds security. Running a full node allows one to verify transactions without trusting any third parties. To run a full node:

1. Download and configure the [Burst Reference Software (BRS)](https://github.com/burst-apps-team/burstcoin/releases).

2. Install Phoenix from source. 

    `git clone git@github.com:burst-apps-team/phoenix.git`

3. Build Phoenix Desktop with the `web` target.

    `npm run build:web`

4. Copy the files from `dist` into your BRS isntallation's `html/ui` folder.

    `cp dist/* [path to your BRS]/html/ui`

5. Restart BRS. Enjoy!
