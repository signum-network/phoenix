/**
 * The API structure returned by [[composeApi]]
 *
 * The programming interface uses a _builder pattern_ to mount an API.
 * For sake of simplicity the [[composeApi]] method mounts the __entire__ API, i.e.
 * all available methods are mounted using this class
 *
 * ```ts
 * const api = composeApi({
 *   nodeHost: 'https://wallet1.burst-team.us:2083', // one of the mainnet nodes
 *   apiRootUrl: '/burst' // endpoint to the BURST API
 * })
 * ```
 *
 * While this is a straightforward way to have access to all BURST functionality, this methods
 * has the disadvantage of including all needed dependencies, thus leading to a bigger bundle, for those
 * who use bundlers like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). To reduce the bundle size, one may mount the API
 * conforming his needs using the [[ApiComposer]] class.
